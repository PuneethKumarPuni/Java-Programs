# Java Objects and Classes

## Overview

In Java, **objects** and **classes** are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). A class defines the structure and behavior (methods) of an object, while an object is an instance of a class. Understanding the relationship between classes and objects is essential for writing Java programs.

### What is a Class?
A **class** in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. In other words, a class provides a structure for creating and using objects.

- **Fields/Attributes**: Variables defined inside a class that hold the object's data.
- **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that manipulate or access the object's data.

### What is an Object?
An **object** is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until objects are created from that class. Each object created from a class has its own copy of fields and methods defined by the class.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class.
- **Attributes and Methods**: An object has attributes (data) and methods (actions) defined by the class.
